<font size="7">   I am a physics researcher interested in studying exotic properties of matter! </font>

Welcome! My name is Guilherme Caumo but you can call me Gui for short. I am a physics graduate student at McGill University interested in pursuing exciting new projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the behaviour of matter.

Currently, I am completing a masterâ€™s thesis on characterizing quantum fluctuations under the supervision of Prof. Peter Grutter. I had great experiences working with the [Grutter Group](https://spm.physics.mcgill.ca/) during the summer of 2023 as an undergraduate researcher and I am thrilled to join it as a graduate student to try my hand at discovering new phenomena at the smallest physical scales.

If you wish to learn more about me! You can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/index.md). You can also navigate the page by clicking on the legend on the left or by pressing "Next" above.

## Here is a picture of the experiment I am currently involved in:

This is an [Atomic Force Microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) that I am working on, informally called R2-D2.
