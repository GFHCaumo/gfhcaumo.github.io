# Introduction

My greatest interest lies in physics, and based on my studies at McGill, I have developed a wide range of interests drawing from my background working in various fields of research ranging from condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and neuroscience. My interest in physics drove me to leave my homeland of Brazil to pursue my Bachelor of Science degree in physics here in Canada, and now guides my ambitions of pursuing a master's and even doctorate degree to become an academic researcher. Now as a graduate student in condensed matter physics, I seek to draw from the many lessons I have learned over the course of my academic career to investigate the many phenomena that can only be found at the smallest scales. 

Apart from academic research, I also value opportunities to teach others about physics. I am a firm believer that science should be accessible to everybody and am always looking out for teaching and outreach opportunities. Currently, I have undertaken positions as a teaching assistant for undergraduate physics courses. During the Fall 2024 semester, I had a fantastic experience helping students taking introductory experimental physics classes to learn how to take measurements and propagate uncertainties, and now look forward to continue seeking teaching positions to continue developing my teaching skills and learning from students along the way.

In my free time, I enjoy trying out new recipes and cooking. Personally, I think the more involved the recipe is the more fun it is to try out, and lately I have taken the hobby of trying to perfect multiple ice cream flavours. I also love to spend my time reading and watching movies, and enjoy writing screenplays to produce films with my friends. As a Latin American studying abroad, I head back home to visit family and friends during the holidays, and I love getting to spend time with my dogs.
