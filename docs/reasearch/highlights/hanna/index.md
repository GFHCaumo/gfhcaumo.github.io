# Cosmic Rays and Gamma-ray Astronomy

In my U1 year at McGill, I expanded upon the skills I developed as a researcher in Brazil while working on the construction of a radiation imager under the supervision of Prof. David Hanna, who taught me data analysis and instrumentation techniques in astroparticle physics and gamma-ray astronomy, allowing me to apply my research skills to solve new problems in a physics-based setting and present my work at multiple talks. 

I significant part of my work involved characterizing instrumentation, participating in
design studies, developing analysis code, and calibrating devices for the development of a radiation imager. I also calculated the [muon lifetime using scintillation detectors](./lifetime.md)) and measured the [lateral distribution of muons in cosmic-ray air showers](./muon.md)). As an outreach project, I also designed and built a model cyclotron using 3D printing.

My work on the lateral distribution of muons in cosmic-ray showers was presented at the Canadian Astro/Particle Summer Student Talk competition and the Trottier Space Institute, slides attached below.
